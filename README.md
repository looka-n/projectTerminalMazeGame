# 2D Maze Game
## Description
The user plays a game on the terminal to traverse a 2D grid of rooms, with its contents being unknown. Each room may contain lurking danger, useful items, or maybe nothing at all. The goal is to get to the finish, located somewhere within the maze.
## Installation
Simply download the repository and run main.py
## How to play
Use number inputs to take action presented through the terminal. Every turn allows a player to take an action, which results in a consequential event within the game.
### Name your character
The player is initally given the ability to enter a name their character.
### Choose your difficulty
The player is also given the choice to face monsters of "beginner" and "expert" difficulty. Depending on which you choose, the monsters will possess varying amounts of health and damage.
### Enter the maze
Once the game starts, the player is placed at the start of the maze, unaware of what lies in their surrounding area. In order to complete the game, the player must explore rooms to find the finish, discovering the maze'ss contents along the way.
* Potions: Upon entering a room with a potion in it, the player takes it, refilling their health back to its maximum value.
* Monsters: There also lies the possibility of encountering goblins, ogres, and trolls. You may either choose to face off against them, or run away to a random adjacent room. Successfully fighting the monster kills it, allowing the player to enter the room freely. Running away, however, leaves the monster alive and keeps it a remaining threat if the player decides to come back.
### Find the finish
Navigate the rooms until the player finds the finish. Upon doing so, the player enters yet another level, with a new location. There are three levels in total.
